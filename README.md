## Zapier Integration

- The `POST /user/:id/data` endpoint triggers a webhook to Zapier with the userâ€™s data and the posted information.
- Ensure you have set up a Zap in Zapier that listens to the webhook and processes the data accordingly.

## Deployment

You can deploy this application to your preferred cloud platform. Make sure to configure environment variables and set up proper deployment scripts.
